# Testing PHP

This is the example project for the 'Testing' topic for the [PHP The Right Way Workshop](http://www.phptherightway.com/#testing).

This project is built using the Lumen framework which is a slim version
of the popular Laravel Framework.

### Serving the app

You can run this app with your favourite method of local deployment but
you may also use the local PHP server by `cd` to the `public` folder and
then running `php -S localhost:8080`. You can then view the app on your
browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
